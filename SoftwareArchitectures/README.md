Team Jupyter consists of four students with different skillsets. We achieve diversity in terms of knowledge, nationality and gender.

## What is [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook "Jupyter Official Git Repo") and why did we choose it?

Jupyter Notebook is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in [this document](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#notebook-app) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

We chose this project not only because we are skilled in JavaScript and Python, but also because it's a high quality product providing opportunity to write code and visualize is together with markdown text to explain the process of what is going on. This is all possible to be done within a browser and running on localhost which makes it the perfect tool to use for different types of projects as well as to just learn Python.
